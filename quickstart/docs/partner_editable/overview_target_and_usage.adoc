This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for
deploying an out-of-band, open-source monitoring stack for AWS. Launched tools come
with the Nubeva Transport Layer Security (TLS) Decrypt platform pre-configured on the
AWS Cloud. The stack includes the open-source tools Arkime, Suricata, Wireshark,
and Zeek.

* **Arkime** is a large-scale, open-source, indexed packet-capture-and-search system.
* **Suricata** is a high-performance engine that comprises a network intrusion detection
system (IDS), an intrusion prevention system (IPS), and network security
monitoring (NSM).
* **Wireshark** is a free, open-source packet analyzer for network troubleshooting.
* **Zeek** is a powerful network analysis framework used for intrusion detection by
looking at anomalous network activity to find suspicious data flows.

This Quick Start is for users who want to identify malicious activity, insider threats, and
data leakage within their virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) instances with decrypted visibility.
