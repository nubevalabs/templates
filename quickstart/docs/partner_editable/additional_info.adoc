== Test the deployment

By default, this Quick Start includes TLS clients that generate standard web traffic as
well as simulated attack instances. To validate the deployment and view the simulated
threats, follow these steps:

. Log in to the Nubeva SaaS console using the credentials you created in Step 2.
. Ensure that you see two instances connected to the console.

[start=3]
. Mirror the traffic from the sources to the tools. Amazon VPC mirror targets have
been preconfigured on the open-source tools. Create an Amazon VPC traffic
mirroring session for your clients, and direct them to the pre-configured
destinations.

[start=4]
. Optional: Monitor additional application instances by launching more Nubeva
agents. Choose the Launch a Sensor icon for instructions on how to deploy a new
agent. Ensure that you define a group for the newly launched agents.

. Each tool should be accessed directly:
.. Arkime: Connect to the administration console using the link listed on the
output of the CloudFormation stack, http://elbaddress:8005. The user
name and password are the tooladmin credentials you submitted.
.. Wireshark: Connect to the wireshark console using the link listed on the
output of the CloudFormation stack, https://elbaddress:14500. The user name and
password are the tooladmin credentials you submitted. Monitor the nurx0 interface
for decrypted cloud traffic.
.. Suricata and Zeek: Connect to the Kibana interface using the link listed on
the output of the CloudFormation stack.
