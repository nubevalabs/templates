== Test the deployment

By default, this Quick Start includes TLS clients that generate standard web traffic as
well as simulated attacks. In addition, VPC traffic mirrors are created between a client and its respective tool.  To validate the deployment and view the simulated
threats, follow these steps:

Each tool should be accessed directly:

. Wireshark: Connect to the wireshark console using the link listed on the
output of the CloudFormation stack, https://elbaddress:14500. The user name and
password are the default wireshark/wireshark credentials. Monitor the nurx0 interface
for decrypted cloud traffic.
[NOTE]
====
This tool uses the default credentials! Tooladmin/Toolpassword parameters are not supported

[start=2]
. Suricata: For alerts, connect to the Kibana interface using the link listed on
the output of the CloudFormation stack.

. Zeek: For alerts, connect to the Kibana interface using the link listed on
the output of the CloudFormation stack.
