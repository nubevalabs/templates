Nubeva’s TLS visibility solution is a software as a service (SaaS) that provides complete
packet visibility of any public cloud with TLS decryption capabilities. All the open-source
tools in this solution are complemented by Nubeva TLS Decrypt, which provides additional
intelligence and insight into encrypted data.

Container-based Nubeva TLS Decrypt sensors are deployed on your monitored instances,
which capture TLS session keys  — as well as associated packet traffic for any instance where
Amazon VPC traffic mirroring isn’t available — as they flow through these instances. The
packets are sent through a secure channel to be analyzed and visualized by the open-source
tools you choose. This provides clear visibility of your network traffic so you can identify
unexpected network behavior, perform network analysis, and detect intrusions.
